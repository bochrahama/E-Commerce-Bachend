    // Generic repository interface for CRUD operations
    //the porpose of this interface is to provide a common set of methods for performing CRUD operations on entities of type T,
    //where T is a class. The interface defines methods for retrieving entities by their unique identifier (GetByIdAsync),
    //retrieving all entities (GetAllAsync), adding new entities (AddSync), updating existing entities (Update), removing entities (Remove),
    //and saving changes to the underlying data store (SaveChangesAsync).
    //By using this generic repository interface, developers can create concrete implementations for
    //specific entity types, promoting code reusability and maintainability in the application.
